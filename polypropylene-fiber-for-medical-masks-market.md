<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polypropylene Fiber for Medical Masks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>≤35 g/10 min</li><li>> 35 g/10 min</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polypropylene fiber for medical masks is categorized based on melt flow index (MFI), which indicates the flow characteristics of the polymer during processing. The ≤35 g/10 min type features fibers that have a lower MFI, making them suitable for applications requiring higher strength and filtration efficiency, often utilized in surgical masks. In contrast, the >35 g/10 min type has a higher MFI, resulting in softer, more elastic fibers, ideal for comfortable, breathable masks. Both types play crucial roles in ensuring effective protection and user comfort in medical settings.</p></p>
